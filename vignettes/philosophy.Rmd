When designing a pipeline some problems are intrinsically interesting, some are
not. Data caching, data transfer, parallelism, execution environment and such
things are boring. The researcher should write pure data transforms, they
should specify invariants and data assumptions, they should determine how
results are presented. These three elements are orthogonal. Data validators and
loggers should not alter the data. Pure functions should not be cluttered with
validator and logging code.
